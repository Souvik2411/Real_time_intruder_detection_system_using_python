# Real-Time-Intruder-Detection-System-using-Arduino-and-Python
In this project we are going to make a real time Intruder Detection System using Arduino and Python. The main features of this project are cost effectiveness, simple functioning which outshines costly IDSs in the market.
# Components used

  A. Pyhton

  B. Email JS

  C. pymata4 library

  D. Push Bullet 
# Circuit Diagram

# Direction of Implementation

  A. Clone this repository or download all the files.

  B. Download and install necessary dependencies and libraries as required. Namely - 
  
      time, pymata4, face_recognition, imutils, pickle, cv2, os, smtplib, imghdr, email, pushbullet

  C.  In the images folder, take and store the pictures of the people you want to designate as owners from different angles and name the folder as the name of the person.

  D.  Then make sure to run the storing_faces.ipynb file to store the face encodings of the owner's face images that we took in step C.

  E.  Connect the the arduino board as per the circuit diagram provided.

  F. Finally, we run the intruder_detection.ipynb file to get the outputs.
